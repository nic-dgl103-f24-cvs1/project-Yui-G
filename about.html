            <h3>System</h3>
            <p>Our farm runs on a best practice system, we use a combination of management that ensures our produce is
                the highest quality possible. We are not currently certified organic but we do grow all produce and
                vegetables organically. Through the use of mechanical and cultural management we keep our farm pests
                under control. </p>
            <h3>Techniques</h3>
            <p>
                Black plastic mulch, flame weeders, roto-tiller and old fashion weeding techniques are
                used to keep encroaching weeds down. Row covers help to keep insect pests out of our susceptible crops
                and a good crop rotation plan ensures that we are keeping pests at a minimum from season to season.
                Fertility is managed here by adding well composted cattle manure as well as our own manure produced by
                our laying hen flock. Supplemental organic fertilizer is added as needed to our drip irrigation system
                throughout the season.</p>
