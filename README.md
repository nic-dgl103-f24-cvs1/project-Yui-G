# Project Website Plan

## Project Summary

- I have chosen kehler vegitable company's website to redesign and built.
  https://www.kehlervegetables.ca/

### Why the client needs a new website

- The purpose of this website is providing information about the company.
- The target is local consumers, and local business such as grocery store and restaurant.
- Overall message that I am trying to convey to the audience is that they are providing great products, which are localy grown and nutritious.
  Getting contact by audience through website is desired action of this website.
  They also provide email and phone number as contact information.
- Why is their current site not appropriate?
  - The current website has unnecessary spacing at the bottom of the website.
  - Each page has same hero & navigation area, so it is hard to tell that you landed at the designated page.
  - Instagram photo of the home page isn't loading.
  - The contrast of body paragraph and background color is not enough.
  - Background image is taking too long to load on mobile.
